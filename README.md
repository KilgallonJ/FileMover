# FileMover
This is a small utility program with a Swing front-end that is designed to help MHR's testers work more effectively. Using a JSON configuration file you can set up directories from which webapp deployment files (such as .war files) can be sourced and then moved to your own machine or deployed directly to your own local application server.

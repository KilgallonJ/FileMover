## FileMover

This is a small, lightweight utility app that simply copies arbitrary files from one location to another at the click of a button. It originally came into being to help my organisation's non-technical testers to easily deploy .war files that they acquired from developers to their local containers.

### Usage

Simply double-click the FileMover.jar file to run it. While the app is running, you can reload the configuration by pressing F5 - this will reread the configuration.json file found in `%USER_HOME%/FileMover/` and refresh the UI accordingly without the need to restart the app.
